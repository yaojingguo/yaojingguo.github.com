Definition. The relation $$\rightarrow$$ on the set of events of
a system is the smallest relation satisfying the following
three conditions: (1) If $$a$$ and $$b$$ are events in the same
process, and $$a$$ comes before $$b$$, then $$a \rightarrow b$$. (2) If $$a$$ is the
sending of a message by one process and $$b$$ is the receipt
of the same message by another process, then $$a \rightarrow b$$. (3)
If $$a \rightarrow b$$ and $$b \rightarrow c$$ then $$a \rightarrow c$$. Two distinct events $$a$$
and $$b$$ are said to be concurrent if $$a \nrightarrow b$$ and $$b \nrightarrow a$$.

We assume that $$a \nrightarrow a$$ for any event a. $$\rightarrow$$ is an irreflexive partial ordering.

Clock Condition For any events a, bï¼šif a $$\rightarrow$$ b, then $$C(a) < C(b)$$.

C1. If $$a$$ and $$b$$ are events in process $$P_i$$ and $$a$$ comes before $$b$$, then $$C_i(a) < C_i(b)$$.

C2. If $$a$$ is the sending of a message by process $$P_i$$
and $$b$$ is the receipt of that message by process $$P_j$$, then
$$C_i(a) < C_j(b)$$.

IR1. Each process $$P_i$$ increments $$C_i$$ between any
two successive events.

IR2. (a) If event $$a$$ is the sending of a message m
by process $$P_i$$, then the message m contains a timestamp
$$T_m= C_i(a)$$. (b) Upon receiving a message m, process
$$P_i$$ sets $$Ci$$ greater than or equal to its present value and
greater than $$T_m$$.
