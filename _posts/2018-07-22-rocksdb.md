# Levelled Compaction vs Universal Compaction
The former only happens between two adjacent sorted runs. The latter happens
between more than 1 adjacent sorted runs.
[Universal-Compaction#conceptual-basis](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Universal-Compaction#conceptual-basis)
gives a high-level description about this.

- Why `exponentially closer?`  
Consider `L0, L1, L3, L4`. After a update is flushed from memtable to L0,

* `L0, L1` are compacted into `L01`
* `L2, L3` are compacted into `L23`
* `L01, L23` are compacted into `L0123`

- Why?
> In leveled compaction, however, an update is compacted more as a part of the
> larger sorted run where a smaller sorted run is merged into, than as a part of
> the smaller sorted run. As a result, in most of the times an update is
> compacted, it is not moved to a larger sorted run, so it doesn't make much
> progress towards the final largest run.

The reason is how we pick SST files? After we pick more than one SST file in
the small level, we need to pick all the overlapping SST files in the large
level.
