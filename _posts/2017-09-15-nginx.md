Run `brew install nginx --with-gunzip` produces:

```
==> Downloading https://nginx.org/download/nginx-1.12.1.tar.gz
######################################################################## 100.0%
==> ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/Cellar/nginx/1.12.1 --with-http_ssl_module --with-pcre --sbin-path=/usr/local/Cellar/nginx/1.12.1/bin/nginx --with-cc-opt=-I/usr/local/o
==> make install
==> Caveats
Docroot is: /usr/local/var/www

The default port has been set in /usr/local/etc/nginx/nginx.conf to 8080 so that
nginx can run without sudo.

nginx will load all files in /usr/local/etc/nginx/servers/.

To have launchd start nginx now and restart at login:
  brew services start nginx
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  nginx
