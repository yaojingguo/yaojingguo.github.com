## Guava
In `Verify.verify`'s error message, only `%s` is supported.

## Logging

### Log4j
- [2.x PatternLayout](https://lPatternLayoutogging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/layouts.html)
- [1.2 PatternLayout](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/PatternLayout.html)
- [wikipedia ISO 8601 page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601)
- [RFC3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339)

In 1.2, `%d{ISO8601}` means the format `yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss,SSS` which is wrong.
The correct format is `yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss,SSS` as specified by
wikipedia ISO 8601 page. 2.x is in consistent with wikipedia.

Without configuration file, lo4j 1.x emits the following message to stdout and
no log4j log messages are printed:

```
log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (language.Log4jLogger).
log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
log4j:WARN See http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#noconfig for more info.
```

Without configuration file, log4j 1.x with slf4j emit the following message to
stdout and no log4j log messages are printed:

```
log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (language.Slf4jLogger).
log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
log4j:WARN See http://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/faq.html#noconfig for more info.
```

Without configuration file, log4j 2.x emits the following message to stdout and
log4j log messages are printed to stdout:


```
ERROR StatusLogger No log4j2 configuration file found. Using default configuration: logging only errors to the console.
19:50:47.889 [main] ERROR com.rainbow.LoggerTest - info message
```

### Logback with slf4j

Without configuration file, logback log message are printed to stdout. For
details, refer to [Chapter 3: Logback configuration](http://logback.qos.ch/manual/configuration.html).

## Build

### Maven
To download a package without a POM file:

```
mvn dependency:get -DgroupId=org.apache.kafka -DartifactId=kafka-clients -Dversion=0.9.0.0
```

*Note* that the above command can't be used to download Javadoc jar or source

jar for a package.

Download Javadoc Jar:

```
mvn dependency:resolve -Dclassifier=javadoc
```

Download source jar:

```
mvn dependency:sources
```

For details, refer to:

- [Get source JARs from Maven repository](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2059431/get-source-jars-from-maven-repository)

### Gradle
Gretty:

- [gradle: failure when plugin task `dependsOn` another plugin task](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28086655/gradle-failure-when-plugin-task-dependson-another-plugin-task)

In different environments, Gradle may execute a set of test cases in different
orders. For example, there are test cases A and B. In environment 1, the
execution order is `A -> B`. In environment 2, the execution order is `B -> A`.
Test case failures related to such kind of execution order are hard to be fixed.

Gradle `eclipse` task downloads source jars by default.

# Web App
RequestDispatcher is confusing. But [Introduction to Request 
Dispatcher](http://www.studytonight.com/servlet/request-dispatcher.php) explains 
it well.

classes places in `src/test/java` are not loaded by `gradle jettyRun`.


## Error Handling in Web App

- If no customized error handling is provided, the default error page provided
  by the container such as Tomcat is returned. The error page usually contains Java
  exception stack trace. HTTP response is a error page with a HTTP status 500.
- Customized error handling usually return a HTTP response with status code 302.
  The browser will then go to the URL contained in `Location` header. So there are
  two HTTP responses: one with status code 302 and one with status code 200. 

One way to do customized error handling is to use a `Filter` to catch the
exception and does the redirect with `HttpServletResponse.sendRedirect`. Such a
filter catches the exceptions thrown by the application code and the exceptions
thrown by Web framework code. If Spring framework is used, a `@ControllerAdvice`
which has some methods annotated with `@ExceptionHandler` can also be used. But
such a controller advice can only catch exceptions thrown by a web controller.

## 404 Not Found Handling in Web App

Approaches:

- Web container returns a 404 page by default. Only one HTTP response is
  produced.
- Web container returns a customized 404 page. Only one HTTP response is
  produced. github.com uses this approach.
- Web container returns a HTTP 302 response. Browser redirects to the `Location`
  header in the response. Two HTTP responses are produced: one HTTP 302 and one
  HTTP 200.

## Servlet
The following conclusion is verified with `gradle jettyRun`.
Filters are initialized before servlets. Unlike servlets which can be lazily
initialized, filters are always initialized when the servlet contains starts up.

### Qualifier

Create the following three classes in a package which is component scaned.

```
@Service
public class Wife {
  public Wife() {
    System.out.println("construct a wife");
  }
}
```

```
@Service
public class Husband {
  public Husband() {
    System.out.println("construct a husband");
  }
}
```

```
@Service
public class Couple {

  @Autowired(required = true)
  public Couple(@Qualifier("husband") Husband husband, @Qualifier("wife") Wife wife) {
    System.out.println("construct a couple");
  }
}
```

A test case which knows how to load application context:

```
public class CoupleTest extends AbstractContextTest {
  @Autowired
  private Couple couple;
  
  @Test
  public void testConstruct() {
    System.out.println(couple);
  }
}
```

Running the test case produces:

```
construct a wife
construct a husband
construct a couple
com.rainbow.service.Couple@733c423e
```

### MVC
If an interceptor's `preHandle` method returns `false` for a HTTP GET, a
response with status code 200 and an empty body may be returned.

### Magic
- `spittleList` for `List<Spittle>` for model name
- In `web.xml`, a serlvet named as `appServlet`'s context is 
  `WEB-INF/appServlet-context.xml`.
- In a application context xml file, the `/` in `<import 
  resource="classpath:/service-config.xml" />` is optional. The reason is that 
  `ClassPathResource.ClassPathResource(String path)` ignores it.
- `supportedMediaTypes` in `HttpMessageConverter` can be used to set HTTP 
  response's `Content-Type` header. `produces = MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON_VALUE` 
  overrides it.

## Allow CORS
Add the following text to web.xml:

```
  <!-- CORS -->
  <filter>
    <filter-name>CorsFilter</filter-name>
    <filter-class>com.rainbow.CorsFilter</filter-class>
  </filter>
  <filter-mapping>
    <filter-name>CorsFilter</filter-name>
    <url-pattern>/rest/*</url-pattern>
  </filter-mapping>
```

CorsFilter:

```
package com.rainbow;

import java.io.IOException;

import javax.servlet.Filter;
import javax.servlet.FilterChain;
import javax.servlet.FilterConfig;
import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.ServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.ServletResponse;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;
/**
 * Filter to allow CORS rest API calls.
 */
public class CorsFilter implements Filter {

  @Override
  public void doFilter(ServletRequest req, ServletResponse resp,
      FilterChain chain) throws IOException, ServletException {
    HttpServletResponse response = (HttpServletResponse) resp;

    response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*");
    response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Methods",
                       "POST, GET, OPTIONS, DELETE");
    response.setHeader("Access-Control-Max-Age", "3600"); // seconds
    response.setHeader("Access-Control-Allow-Headers", "Origin, X-Requested-With, Content-Type, Accept");

    chain.doFilter(req, resp);
  }

  @Override
  public void init(FilterConfig filterConfig) throws ServletException {}

  @Override
  public void destroy() {}
}
```

## JDBC
Before Java 7:

```
Connection conn = ...;
try {
  // SQL statements
  conn.commit(); 
} catch (Throwable t) {
  if (conn != null) conn.rollback();
} finally {
  if (conn != null) conn.close();
  }
}
```

Java 7 and above:


```
try (Connection conn = ...;) {
  conn.commit();
} 
```

The above code works only if `Connection.close` method does `rollback` if
`conn.commit()` is not executed. Java 8 `Connection.close` method's Javadoc
discourages this way.

And remember to always invoke `Connection.close()` to release database resources.
If a thrown exception causes Java process to terminate, the OS will terminate
the Java process's TCP connection to the remote database server. The database
server can release related resources. The related database resources will not be
released for the following cases:

- The exception is swallowed or the
- Network cable is unplugged suddenly. In this case, the OS hosting Java process
  does not have a change to send more TCP packages to do a graceful TCP close
  with the remote database server.

Be careful with JDBC url in Java code. Some unrecognized options are ignored
silently. If the JDBC url is given literally in XML, `&` needs to be escaped. If
the JDBC url is given in a properties file, don't escape it.
