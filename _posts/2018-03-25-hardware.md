> SSD endurance is commonly described in terms of full Drive Writes Per Day (DWPD) for a certain warranty period (typically 3 or 5 years). In other words, if a 100GB SSD is specified for 1 DWPD, it can withstand 100GB of data written to it every day for the warranty period. Alternatively, if a 100GB SSD is specified for 10 DWPD, it can withstand 1TB of data written to it every day for the warranty period.
