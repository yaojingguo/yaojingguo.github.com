(1) gives a good overview of IEE 754.

`Float.floatToIntBits(0.1f)` gives `3dcccccd`. 

```
#include <stdio.h>
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
  float f = 0.1; 
  printf("0x%8x\n", *((int*) &f));
  printf("0x%x\n", *((unsigned char*) &f) & 0xff);
  return 0;
}
```

The above code gives:

```
0x3dcccccd
0xcd
```

The memory layout of 0.1 in little endian format is:

```
Address
 lower     cd
   |       cc
   |       cc
   V       3d
 higher

```

[Float.toString's Javadoc](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Float.html#toString-float-)
explains how to get the string representation of a Float.

The following Java code:

```
    System.out.println(0.1);
    System.out.printf("%f\n", 0.1);
    System.out.printf("%.14f\n", 0.1);
    float f = 0.1f;
    System.out.printf("%f\n", f);
    System.out.printf("%.14f\n", f);
```

gives:

```
0.1
0.100000
0.10000000000000
0.100000
0.10000000149012
```

The following C code:

```
  printf("%f\n", 0.1);
  printf("%.14f\n", 0.1);
  printf("%f\n", f);
  printf("%.14f\n", f);
```

gives:

```
0.100000
0.10000000000000
0.100000
0.10000000149012
```
[12.12.5 Floating-Pointersions](http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Floating_002dPoint-Conversions.html)
says that the default precision for `%f` is 6. So `0.1` with `%f` produces
`0.100000`.

Decimal `0.1` can't be represented precisely in IEEE 754.

```
0.1 x 2 = 0.2      0
0.2 x 2 = 0.4      0
0.4 x 2 = 0.8      0
0.8 x 2 = 1.6      1
0.6 x 2 = 1.2      1
0.2 x 2 = 0.4      0
```
(0.1)<sub>10</sub> = (0.0__0011__)<sub>2</sub>. __0011__ is the repeated part.

### Denormal Numbers

(1) says:

> Many older floating point standards disallow such denormal numbers, leading to
> a gap between zero and the smallest representable positive number that is
> larger than the gap between the two smallest representable positive numbers.

If denormal numbers are disallowed, `a = 1.00000000000000000000000 * 2^min`
(`min` is `-127` for single presion floating numbers) is the
smallest representable positive number. `b = 1.00000000000000000000001 * 2^min`
is the next smallest representable positive number. 

```
The gap between zero and the smallest representable positive number:  
  gap_a_0 = a - 0 = 1.00000000000000000000000 * 2^min
The gap between the two smallest representable positive numbers:      
  gap_b_a = b - a = 0.00000000000000000000001 * 2^min
```

It is obvious that `gap_a_0` is much larger thant `gap_b_a`.

If denormal numbers are allowed, the denormal number 
`0.00000000000000000000001 * 2^(min+1)` is the smallest representable positive
number. And the denormal number `0.00000000000000000000002 * 2^(min+1)` 
is the next smallest representable positive number.

```
The gap between zero and the smallest representable positive number:  
  gap_a_0 = a - 0 = 0.00000000000000000000001 * 2^(min+1)
The gap between the two smallest representable positive numbers:      
  gap_b_a = b - a = 0.00000000000000000000001 * 2^(min+1)
```

Now `gap_b_a` is equal to `gap_a_0`.
