## Database Logging
```
          FORCE    !FORCE
STEAL     UNDO     UNDO/REDO
!STEAL    UNDO     REDO
```

STEAL/FORCE needs UNDO logs because a dirty page may be flushed to durable
storage before commit.
!STEAL/FORCE also needs UNDO logs. The reason is that there might be a database
crash during flushing the dirty pages.
