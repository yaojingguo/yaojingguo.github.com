## Java
After using `brew cask install java` to install Java, Java updater will update Java. But Java updater will only update Java in
`/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home/bin` whose version can be checked with `System Preferences->Java Control Panel`. It will
not touch Java in `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines`.

## Redis
`brew install redis`:
```
==> Pouring redis-4.0.8.high_sierra.bottle.tar.gz
==> Caveats
To have launchd start redis now and restart at login:
  brew services start redis
Or, if you don't want/need a background service you can just run:
  redis-server /usr/local/etc/redis.conf
==> Summary
🍺  /usr/local/Cellar/redis/4.0.8: 13 files, 2.8MB
```

## 一支红杏
It seems that `ssh` command honours `ShadowsocksX`'s global mode. But `go get`
and `dep` does not honour global mode.
