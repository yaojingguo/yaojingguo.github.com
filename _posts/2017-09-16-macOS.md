## Java
After using `brew cask install java` to install Java, Java updater will update Java. But Java updater will only update Java in
`/Library/Internet Plug-Ins/JavaAppletPlugin.plugin/Contents/Home/bin` whose version can be checked with `System Preferences->Java Control Panel`. It will
not touch Java in `/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines`.

## 一支红杏
It seems that `ssh` command honour `ShadowsocksX`'s global mode. But ‘go get’ and dep does not honour global mode.
