- `i`: `has identity` – i.e. and address, a pointer, the user can determine whether two copies are identical, etc.
- `m`: `can be moved from` – i.e. we are allowed to leave to source of a "copy" in some indeterminate, but valid state

- `iM`: has identity and cannot be moved from
- `im`: has identity and can be moved from (e.g. the result of casting an lvalue
  to a rvalue reference)
- `Im`: does not have identity and can be moved from. The fourth possibility (IM:
  doesn’t have identity and cannot be moved) is not useful in C++ (or, I think) in any other language.

```
