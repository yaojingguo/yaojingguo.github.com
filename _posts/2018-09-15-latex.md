## XeLaTeX
I have tried many ways to input Chinese characters on macOS. I only suceed with
XeLaTeX.

```latex
\documentclass{article}
\usepackage{fontspec}
\setromanfont{STSong}
\begin{document}
中文
\end{document}
```

1. `algorithms` package: last updated on August 24, 2009
2. `listings` package: last updated on 2019/02/27
3. `algorithm2e` package: last updated on July 18 2017
4. `algorithmicx` package: last updated on April 27, 2005

Since 1 and 3 are recommended by ACM, and 3 is more recently updated, 3 is my
choice.


## Fonts

- [Serif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serif)
- [Sans-serif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sans-serif)
- [Courier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courier_(typeface))

From https://www.creativebloq.com/typography/free-typewriter-fonts-1131774:
> Much like retro fonts, typewriter fonts are a popular choice to incorporate into vintage-style designs. Courier is probably the best known font of this type but there are many free fonts out there to choose from.

From https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/XeLaTeX:
> Different elements in a LATEX document are formatted with different fonts, for example in a verbatim environment the text is displayed using a typewriter style.

> \setmonofont{Courier New}
Everithing that must be formatted with a Typewritter font in your document will use the Courier New font. This command has an extra optional parameter inside braces:

`brew cask upgrade mactex`:

Error: The `brew link` step did not complete successfully
The formula built, but is not symlinked into /usr/local

already exists. You may want to remove it:
  rm '/usr/local/bin/dvipdf'

To force the link and overwrite all conflicting files:
  brew link --overwrite ghostscript

To list all files that would be deleted:
  brew link --overwrite --dry-run ghostscript

Possible conflicting files are:

`brew link --overwrite --dry-run ghostscript` gives:

Would remove:
/usr/local/bin/gs -> /usr/local/bin/gs-noX11
```

`/usr/local/bin/gs` does not exist.
